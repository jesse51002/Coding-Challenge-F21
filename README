My Soution to this problem had 5 parts.

1. Clean the input by removing unneeded symbols and extra characters that would hinder the processing
2. Removing stop words that add no value to the sentence
3. Using a sentiment dictionary to figure out the sentiments of words
4. Find whether to negate the sentiment value of sentences using negation words
5. Find the average of the sentiments of all the useful words in the input

The program outputs a sentiment value from range [-1,1] where 1 is extremely positive, 0 is neutral and -1 is negative.
My method got me a sentiment value of 0.1206896551724138 with the given input.
